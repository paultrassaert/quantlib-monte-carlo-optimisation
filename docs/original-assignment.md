## Coding project: use constant parameters in Monte Carlo engines

In Monte Carlo engines, repeated calls to the process methods may
cause a performance hit; especially when the process is an instance of
the `GeneralizedBlackScholesProcess` class, whose methods in
turn make expensive method calls to the contained term structures.

The performance of the engine can be increased at the expense of some
accuracy.  Create a new class that models a Black-Scholes process with
constant parameters (underlying value, risk-free rate, dividend yield,
and volatility); then modify the Monte Carlo engines copied in this
repository so that they still take a generic Black-Scholes process and
an additional boolean parameter.  If the boolean is `false`, the
engine runs as usual; if it is `true`, the engine extracts the
constant parameters from the original process (based on the exercise
date of the option; for instance, the constant risk-free rate should
be the zero-rate of the full risk-free curve at the exercise date) and
runs the Monte Carlo simulation with an instance of the constant
process.

**You should not modify the `main.cpp` file, only the engines and the
new constant process.**

After your modifications:

1. **Compare the results** (value, elapsed time) obtained with and without
   constant parameters.  The value with non-constant parameters should
   be the same returned from the original engine in QuantLib.  The
   value with constant parameters might change (but not too much),
   and hopefully the elapsed time should decrease.

2. **Try to avoid duplication** between the three engines that you are
   modifying (European, Asian, lookback).  Ideally, some of the
   additional code (for instance, extracting the constant parameters
   based on exercise date and strike) should be written just once.

3. **Reflect on your results.**  Are the results what you expected?
   Are there any differences between the results for the three
   engines?  If so, can you figure out why?


## How to submit your solution

1. **Get a GitHub account**, if you don't have one already.

2. **Fork this repository** using the "Fork" button in the top right
   corner of the page (if you're not reading this on GitHub, go to
   <https://github.com/lballabio/IMT2026> first).  More detailed
   instructions are available at
   <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>

3. **Clone your fork on your machine**.  To compile and run the
   program on your machine you'll need QuantLib installed;
   instructions to do that for different operating systems are at
   <https://www.quantlib.org/install.shtml>.

4. **Modify the source files** as required by the project.  Feel free to
   add any other file you might need. You can also add your
   presentation.

5. **Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request**;
   instructions for that are available at
   <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>.  This will
   enable me to see your progress, to comment on your changes, and to
   suggest further changes if necessary.  When you push new changes to
   your fork, they will be added to the existing pull request
   automatically; there's no need to open a new one.


Good luck!

## How to build and run the project

### Compilation

You can compile the project using:

```bash
make
```

On some systems (especially macOS with Homebrew like ours), the Boost headers are
not automatically found by the compiler.

To fix this without modifying the Makefile, you can specify the include path manually:

```bash
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/boost/include make
```
